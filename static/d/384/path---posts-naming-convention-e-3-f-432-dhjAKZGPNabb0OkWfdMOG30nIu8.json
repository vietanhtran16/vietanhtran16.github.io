Of course, it was not an easy read that you could skim through in a week or two. It is also a book that is not easy to perceive thorougly first time around so I will definitely come back to it later on.</p>\n<p>Naming convention is probably what made me realised how ugly my code had been. We have all named a variable like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">var test = &quot;We all been here&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>or this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">public void ConvertSomething(){\n\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>We all planned to go back and change the name (or at least me) later on but never got to it.</p>\n<p>So here are some of the key points about <strong>Naming Conventions</strong> that I learnt from Clean Code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly reveal the its intent</li>\n<li>Explain the object clearly</li>\n<li>Could help others in maintaining your code</li>\n<li>Should not use single letter name for object</li>\n<li>Should have style for code format using tool such as Resharper</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not name two objects similarly. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eg: user and users</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pick one word per concept. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eg: choose between send or post</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/clean-code/","/tags/naming/"],"slug":"/posts/naming-convention/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Is naming important?","tags":["clean code","naming"],"date":"2017-12-03T16:51:00.000Z","description":"What have I learned about naming?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/naming-convention/"}}
